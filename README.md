# BFR-Algorithm

Assignment for Data Mining Course.

BFR for Bradley-Fayyad-Reina algorithm.

Since the BFR algorithm has a strong assumption that the clusters are normally distributed with
independent dimensions, we generated synthetic datasets by initializing some random centroids and
creating some data points with the centroids and some standard deviations to form the clusters.
